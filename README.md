## Image Generation using DCGAN
Tensorflow implementation of Number Generation using DCGAN from the paper [Deep Convolutional Generative Adversial Network](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.06434.pdf)
### Result
This is the result of training for 30 epochs, more epochs will tend to provide better results.
